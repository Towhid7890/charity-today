                <p>The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to
                    have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well. <br> Be nice to people... maybe
                    it'll be unappreciated, unreciprocated, or ignored, but spread the love anyway. We rise by lifting
                    others.

                hand especially when times are tough.</p>
